# jessicadigital/shield-drupal8

This Drupal 8 module is based on a port of the Shield module for Drupal 7.

When installed, the module will provide HTTP basic authentication for the site, giving a primitive way of hiding a development or staging area from search engines and prying eyes.

Enter specific URLs in the whitelisting area to prevent authentication - useful for testing services such as payment gateways.
